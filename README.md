# Automatidata (NYC Taxi & Limousine) Ride Sharing and Tip Prediction

This project involves an end-to-end analysis of a ride-sharing dataset from Automatidata (NYC Taxi & Limousine) to uncover insights into customer behavior and fare patterns, and to build predictive models for fare amounts and tip behavior.

## Project Overview

The project aimed to analyze a comprehensive ride-sharing dataset to understand various aspects of customer behavior, fare structures, and tipping habits. A key objective was to build machine learning models for predicting fare amounts and whether a customer would leave a tip.

## Key Highlights

* **Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to gain insights into ride distances, fare amounts, tip behavior, and payment types (cash vs. credit card).
* **Performed A/B testing** to analyze the statistical relationship between fare amounts and payment method, determining the influence of payment type on fare size.
* **Built a Multiple Linear Regression model** to predict fare amounts, utilizing features such as mean ride distance and duration.
* **Developed and evaluated machine learning classification models** (Random Forest and XGBoost) to predict whether a customer would not leave a tip.
* **Applied hyperparameter tuning** to optimize model performance and achieve a prediction accuracy of **71%** for the tip prediction model.
